# Guessing-Numbers-Game
A little terminal game I made using Python 

Enter a number to guess when prompted, the terminal will tell you whether the guess is right or wrong, if you get it wrong 3 times it will give you a hint
If you get it right you get a point and the game restarts

Game ends when you guess incorrectly 7 times in a row.

Have Fun!
